This project uses a genetic algorithm to pack a 2-D bin with boxes. The packing algorithm , here called the bottom lower corner, is based of the well known 
bottom left corner algirthm. This algorithm follows a similar rule except that it always chooses the lowest corner rather then always choosing the left 
corner. It has the option of using different operators for each of its steps. The create boxespy script creates box that maybe importanted into the program 
for repeatable results. The boxes are created through recursion. A design of experiment was done to optimize the parameters for this program. The results 
displayed that this algorithm perfromed better then the well known bottom left corner.
